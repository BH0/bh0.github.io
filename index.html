    <p>HTML5 Canvas Game - Present Collect </p>
<p>In this blog post we will create a simple game using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. You will learn how to deal with objects, organise your code and implementing simple game concepts such as a game loop and collision detection using Javascript. </p>
<p>About our game, the player will be an elf character, and the user will use their mouse (by dragging) to move the player object towards a present which when collided with will increase the score, however if the player object collides with something which is not a present (�bad.jpg�) they will lose a point. </p>
<p>Firstly, we must ensure we have the correct file/folder structure as well as the necessary assets. I�m no artist so you�re welcome to use my �placeholder� graphics which I have provided or use your own assets for graphics. We will be representing each game object by its own file, which will contain a constructor function - checkout my introduction to JS objects post: <a href="https://bh0.github.io/2017/11/10/A-Simplified-Introduction-To-Objects-In-Javascript/">https://bh0.github.io/2017/11/10/A-Simplified-Introduction-To-Objects-In-Javascript/</a> . </p>
<p>Here is what the folder/file structure should look like </p>
<ul>
<li>images<br>  – bad.jpg<br>  – player.jpg<br>  – present.jpg </li>
<li>objects<br>  – present.js<br>  – hud.js<br>  – elf.js </li>
<li>index.html </li>
<li>main.js </li>

/// Collision/s 
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<p>/// Repeatedly call update function (Game Loop)<br>setInterval(update, fps);</p>
<p>/// Global Functions</p>
<hr>
<p>I hope the comments are explanatory enough, notice how I used them to title the sections of the game, this will help us understand where to implement each features code. We are initializing the object�s as either simple variables (<code>var varName</code>) or empty arrays (<code>var arrayName = []</code>) outside of the functions so that we have them in our global scope despite that we aren�t doing anything with them until inside of the functions - for a better understanding of this technique research Javascript hoisting�. You will see how intervals comes into play later on, it is used to simulate a timer. We attach an event listener to the document which will be used for determining the mouse�s position coordinates, we do this in the init function because an event listener will repeatedly listen therefor doesn�t have to be in a loop. �elf.move(e);� doesn�t exist yet so is currently commented out. Remember the �init� only gets called once whereas loop gets called every 30th (you�re welcome change this) frame per millisecond by using �setInterval�. Global functions are where our game functions which don�t have to be inside the game objects them self will go - just about any other function will be local to our game objects. </p>
<p>Here is the player (elf) object�s code which goes inside our elf.js file: </p>
<hr>
<p>function Elf() {<br>    this.position = {<br>        x: canvasWidth/2, y: 350<br>    };<br>    this.width = 30;<br>    this.height = 30;</p>
<pre><code>/// Move Object

this.move = function(e) {
    this.position.x = e.clientX;
    this.position.y = e.clientY;
}

/// Display
var image = new Image();
image.src = &quot;./images/player.jpg&quot;;
this.display = function() {
    ctx.drawImage(image, this.position.x, this.position.y, this.width, this.height);
}
</code></pre><p>}</p>
<hr>
<p>Firstly, we set the starting position of the object, We then move the object by setting this object�s position to the mouse�s position. And then we display the image. Inside our event-listener we can uncomment the �elf.move(e)� line. Also inside our main.js file we have to call the appropriate move function - at the �Display� section after we clear the canvas simply put �elf.display();� - if we put this before we clear the canvas we won�t see anything. And inside our init function at the �Create Objects� section  put �elf = new Elf();�. </p>
<p>If we run our game we should now be able to move a character around the screen (canvas) using our mouse. </p>
<p>It gets better. Lets add in our score just now. Which is pretty simple. Inside our hud.js file put the following code. Don�t forget to create the object by assigning it to the �hud� variable�s value underneath �elf = new Elf();�. </p>
<hr>
<p>function Hud() { // can also double up as a/the GUI<br>    this.score = 0;<br>    this.display = function() {<br>        ctx.font = “40px Arial”;<br>        ctx.fillStyle = “black”;<br>        ctx.fillText(“Score: “+this.score, canvasWidth/2, 100);<br>    }<br>}</p>
<hr>
<p>Now we have one more object to add - and then we will have somewhat of a playable game. We are going to have one present but it will also double up as a �do not collect� object depending on one of its variable�s values - this �do not collect� object will decrease the score when the player collides with it, you can make it whatever you like; a lion, a reindeer, a bomb, you choose. </p>
<hr>
<p>function Present() {<br>    this.badPresent = randomChoice();<br>    this.width = 30;<br>    this.height = 30;</p>
<pre><code>this.position = {
    x: Math.floor(Math.random() * canvasWidth),
    y: Math.floor(Math.random() * canvasHeight)
}

var img = new Image();   // Create new img element
if (this.badPresent) {
    img.src = &apos;./images/bad.jpg&apos;;
} else {
    img.src = &apos;./images/present.jpg&apos;;
}
this.display = function() {
    ctx.drawImage(img, this.position.x, this.position.y, this.width, this.height);
}

this.newPos = function() {
    this.position.y = Math.floor(Math.random() * canvasHeight);
    this.position.x = Math.floor(Math.random() * canvasWidth);
}

/// Collision/s
this.collision = function(other) {
    if (this.position.x &lt; other.position.x + other.width &amp;&amp;
        this.position.x + this.width &gt; other.position.x &amp;&amp;
        this.position.y &lt; this.position.y + this.height &amp;&amp;
        this.height + this.position.y &gt; this.position.y) {
        return true;
    }
}

<hr>
<p>Alright, inside our present object you can see we are setting �badPresent� to the value of this function, this is essentially saying �if badPresent is equal to 1/true the player should lose a point upon collision, otherwise, the player should score a point upon collision�. </p>
<p>Now we have all the code for our individual objects, however we still need to do stuff with these objects to make our game �fun�. </p>
<p>Firstly, we will create a present object every so often (using the modulus operator and the �intervals� variable. Inside our update function put the following code </p>
<hr>
<pre><code>intervals += 1;

/// Create Objects (Periodically)
if (intervals % 120 === 0) {
    present.push(new Present());
}
</code></pre><hr>
<p>Here we are repeatedly adding 1 (incrementing by 1) <em>time unit</em> and within the if statement determining if a certain amount of time (120 <em>time unit</em>) has passed. The reason I said time unit instead of specifying the actual unit is that I don�t know what the actual unit is (math isn�t my strong part right now). Anyway basically when intervals modulus 120 is equal to zero a new present will be added to our array of present objects. The reason we�re using an array is so that it makes it easy for us to remove the objects when we choose to. </p>
<p>We need to display the present object by looping through each object inside our array of objects and ensuring each object �display� function is called (and display the HUD/score) as well. This code will do that - put it under �elf.display();� inside our update�s function  </p>
<hr>
<pre><code>for (var p = 0; p &lt; present.length; p++) {
    present[p].display();
}
hud.display();
</code></pre><hr>
<p>Now that our present objects are visible, our game may end up becoming pretty crowded by the variants of the present object which the player is to avoid, so we after so many milliseconds we will delete a �do not collect� present object - similar to how we are creating the present objects. </p>
<hr>
<pre><code>/// Delete badPresent (to keep the game-world from being overcrowded)
if (intervals % 360 === 0) {
    for (var p = 0; p &lt; present.length; p++) {
        if (present[p].badPresent) {
            present.splice(present.indexOf(present[p].badPresent), 1);
            intervals = 0;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><hr>
<p>We have to loop through each present object, check if it is a �do not collect� object and remove it using �present.splice�� if so. </p>
<p>Now lets detect for a collision between the player and the present object and adjust the score accordingly - do this inside the main.js file underneath the �Collisions� section. </p>
<hr>
<pre><code>/// Collision/s
for (var p = 0; p &lt; present.length; p++) {
    if (present[p].collision(elf) &amp;&amp; !present[p].badPresent) {
        hud.score++;
        present.splice(present.indexOf(present[p]), 1);
    } else if (present[p].collision(elf) &amp;&amp; present[p].badPresent) {
        hud.score -= 1;
        elf.position.y = 350;
        elf.position.x = canvasWidth/2;
        present[p].newPos();
    }
}
</code></pre><hr>
<p>If our present is not a �do not collect�/bad present object we will delete it from the game world and increase the player�s score, otherwise if it is we will give the present object a new position and decrease the hud.score by 1 (you can simulate a �death� event here if you like). </p>
<p>And congratulations. We now have a playable game. If you want to improve up on it here are some recommendations. Implement more objects (such as trees and other scenery). Implement a �lerp� mechanic which will mean the player (elf) object will gradually move towards the mouse�s position - see: <a href="https://github.com/mattdesl/lerp" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/mattdesl/lerp</a> - if you�re not famillar with Node-Package-Manager simply navigation to �index.js� for the actual code. You could also implement a lives and/or health system (where a life is lost each time the player touches a �do not collect� object). And we could communicate with the user using the �alert� command but it�d be much more impressive if you implemented your own graphical user interface such as a menu system. </p>
<p>I may expand on this tutorial either within this blog post or (a) seperate blog post/s. Thanks for reading. </p>

    <p>The scope of this post: this post will cover what objects are, how to create your own object and access an object�s data. But it will not touch on prototypes, parents and children, destroying objects and when to use a particular method of creating an object (it also ignores JSON format and leaves a lot out regarding scope). It also ignores many other topics related to object oriented programming. </p>
<p>Firstly, what is an object and why might we want one? Objects can be containers of data - think �variables on steroids�, the great thing about them is that it can be a decent chunk of code written once but reused multiple times in multiple ways - this is accomplishable as you can create as many instances of an object as you want - an instance is essentially the object with it’s own ID meaning it won’t affect the others. They’re often used for namespacing too. Also, everything or at least most things in Javascript is an object. </p>
<p>##How to create an object: There are three ma8n ways </p>
<pre><code>/// Object Literal 
var car = { 
    fuelVariable: 300, 
    driveFunction: function() {

    } 
}
</code></pre><p>/// �new� and Constructor Functions (similar to classes - first letter should be capitalised)<br>var car = new Object;<br>function Person(age) {<br>   this.personAge = age;<br>}<br>var oldPerson = new Person(200); // new AnArray().localArray[1];<br>console.log(“age: “ + oldPerson.personAge); </p>
<pre><code>
</code></pre><p>var car2 = Object.create(car);<br>``` </p>
<p>Try not to get confused by the syntax. To access data inside an object simply do �objectName.variableName� or �this.propertyName� if you’re inside the object - a property is anything you associate with that particular object. Personally I use the Constructor function or the Object Literal method which I’ll hopefully explain why in a future post. </p>

            When Automation Is Moral - My Opinion
        </a>

        2017-10-29
        
    </p>
    <!-- Content -->
    <p>I watched an excellent programme on television called �The Art of Gothic: Britain�s Midnight Hour�. It discussed several interesting things such as Karl Marx;s opinion on capitalism - and suggested Capitalism is much like a vampire. It also mentioned technology such as industrial robots are in a way: vampiric. </p>
<p>And with machine learning being such a popular trend these days, and large corporations attempting to automate many tasks - it makes sense that people are worried about their jobs being �stolen� by robots. So, even though in the future I might revise my opinion on this subject - this blog post is about my opinion on when we should and shouldn�t try to automate processes. </p>
<p>Let us first know the advantages of automation. As there is less time to spend on labour, and there are less labourers to pay - I think we can agree it is cheaper in the long run. It means that less living organisms have to encounter dangerous situations - thus making it safer, and it also means there is little to no room for human error - thus making things much more predictable and therefore less riskier. </p>
<p>Now, the disadvantages - right now I can only think of one: �people losing their jobs�. Personally, my younger self would be quite surprised by the main disadvantage of automation - less people needing to work. Many people complain about having to go to work, so why are people so fussed about robots taking the jobs thus meaning we don�t have to work? Sadly, the answer isn�t so simple. My first point would be that people are uncertain as to how their future without work will be - there are many breakthroughs which imply the robots will aoon successfully �steal� worker�s jobs, yet little to no evidence that those people who got their jobs �stolen� will be compensated. Perhaps, some people secretly love their work regardless of how terrible it is - maybe they like the routine and the responsibility, and knowing their place in the world. </p>
<p>One thing I will say is, automation doesn�t seem to fit in a capitalistic system (which has existed long before electricity). If there is no work to do, there are no people to exchange their time (labor) for reward (income) by doing the work. The system will have to change for automation to feel right. </p>
<p>I think we should find somewhat of a compromise when it comes to automation. Firstly, I think those whose jobs are at risk due to automation should either be re-trained and thus re-employed elsewhere (whether it be elsewhere in the company or not), or financially compensated. Some people might think it is unfair that people who are forced to lose their job get compensated, but from my perspective it is fair - and unfairness has existed in this world for as long (perhaps longer) than capitalism. </p>
<p>And while there are tremendous advantages to business owners regarding automation, I think many areas should simply not be automated unless they �qualify� for automation. Something should only qualify when it suffers from one or more of the following circumstances: a lack of people entering the job market in this particular area - such as people simply not wanting to do the job (this can fluctuate meaning the automation should only be temporary), and when the work that needs doing is too dangerous/hazardous to be done by a living organism. </p>
<p>The automation will be immoral when: there are plenty of people aspiring to do the particular job and/or there are already plenty doing the particular job, the work is not dangerous enough and the workers are unable to be compensated or trained and employed elsewhere (such as a different sector of the same company), the automation is only aspired to reduce costs yet offers little to no benefit elsewhere, and when the process which is to be automated can be performed better by a living organism than a non-biological being.  </p>
<p>Automation should be a tool to sustain the economy, not boost it rapidly. </p>
<p>Although having said all this, personally I feel we are a long way away from having to worry about the tradeoff/s of automation since the automation itself is a source of jobs (unless the robots and code is being written by non biological technology). Plus we will likely still need people to monitor the automated processes to ensure they are going as expected. But, I suppose it isn�t too early to start preparing for what could possibly be the inevitable. </p>

    <h3 id="Arduino-September-Blog-Post"><a href="#Arduino-September-Blog-Post" class="headerlink" title="Arduino September Blog Post"></a>Arduino September Blog Post</h3><p>I�ve always been into electrical devices and slightly aspire to develop my own robotic application, so I was motivated to learn some electrical circuitry. Around the time of November 2016, I considered getting either the Arduino or Raspberry Pi. I decided to get the Arduino and got it during December. I continued doing some research into the device as well as general electronics. Then from January until July I vowed to make at least one electronic circuit along with its custom program (sketch) per month. And did some studying too. </p>
<p>I now feel fairly familiar with basic electronics and microcontroller programming. So this blog post will tell you about the projects which gave me the knowledge I have today. The reason I�m doing this is that I plan on increasing the scope of my projects but by adding complexity I�ll be requiring more time but I may not be able to develop as frequently as I;d like to due to other commitments. For just about every one of these projects I used: the Arduino IDE, Fritzing, and a text-editor / word processor. </p>
<p>The code and possibly a Frizzing diagram of the circuit for these projects is viewable via Github. </p>
<h3 id="January-ICanSingARainbow"><a href="#January-ICanSingARainbow" class="headerlink" title="January - ICanSingARainbow"></a>January - ICanSingARainbow</h3><p>Components: Breadboard, RGB Led, Wires<br>Description:Essentially my earliest Arduino project, all it was was an RGB LED which displayed each colour of the rainbow.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="February-MorseCode"><a href="#February-MorseCode" class="headerlink" title="February - MorseCode"></a>February - MorseCode</h3><p>A circuit and sketch which went through the alphabet in Morse code and outputted it via two LEDs.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="March-RockPaperScizzors-Simulation"><a href="#March-RockPaperScizzors-Simulation" class="headerlink" title="March -  RockPaperScizzors Simulation"></a>March -  RockPaperScizzors Simulation</h3><p>The scope of this project was way too big for the free time that I had, however it allowed me to simulate the result I wanted to achieve without running into too much hassle. I also enjoyed brainstorming the project�s user experience and interface design. At a later date I hope to return to this project and complete it.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="April-ToneTest"><a href="#April-ToneTest" class="headerlink" title="April - ToneTest"></a>April - ToneTest</h3><p>This was just to experiment with what can be done with a Piezo buzzer. I remember making an interesting �revving� sound.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="May-AlternatingLEDs"><a href="#May-AlternatingLEDs" class="headerlink" title="May - AlternatingLEDs"></a>May - AlternatingLEDs</h3><p>I originally planned to work with a DC or Servo motor and while I wrote the code for one of these motors, realised I didn�t have time to complete the circuit so I instead made a quick sketch and circuit which helped me revise some skills I had previously learnt by making two LEDs light up at different times.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="June-Piezo-Buzzer-Sketch"><a href="#June-Piezo-Buzzer-Sketch" class="headerlink" title="June - Piezo Buzzer Sketch"></a>June - Piezo Buzzer Sketch</h3><p>A circuit which I am very proud of, I made it play a small version of �Twinkle Twinkle� and also composed some tunes/melodies of my own - exercising my high school music theory knowledge. The project also gave me an opportunity to produce my own libraries (using header files).<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="July-Temp-Sensor-RGB-LED"><a href="#July-Temp-Sensor-RGB-LED" class="headerlink" title="July - Temp Sensor RGB LED"></a>July - Temp Sensor RGB LED</h3><p>Just a quick project to based on a combination of my early projects, instead of going through the hassle of building this circuit, I instead decided to test the sketch�s code and circuit using Circuits.io / Electronics Lab (Autodesk) - a web-based application which allows you to make and simulate circuits virtually. The LED is supposed to display a warm colour (red, orange etcetera) depending on the warmth Of The temperature sensor, or a cold colour (blue) if it is cold.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>

<p>As a programmer you�re more than likely to encounter a problem or error which youll struggle to handle.</p>
<p>It may be tempting to not tell anyone about it and suffer in silence - until you accomplish your task. Conquering something alone can feel rewarding, but sometimes you just have to put your dignity in the drawer, and lock it.</p>
<p>By this I mean: ask for help. Don�t worry about feeling negative or not smart enough etcetera. Sometimes you might go to ask for help, but as you verbally (or textually) explain your issue discover the solution.</p>
<p>While I encourage asking for help, I discourage deliberately wasting other peoples time - so make sure you really do need help and you have an idea as to the kind of help you need. It may help to read The XY problem�.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to asking for help - or at least sharing your problem / activity and not suffering in silence.</p>
<p>If you have something to share, share it with others, they might be able to help. By sharing your successes AND STRUGGLES with others you�ll improve your ability to communicate, are relieving yourself from unwanted stress, are stimulating the minds of others (many benefits to this) and you might actually make it through your current struggle.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, the intention of this post is to inform you that socialising can actually be productive even when you think it won�t be. Thanks for reading.</p>

<h1 id="Learn-the-basics-of-Brainfuck-and-Pseudocode"><a href="#Learn-the-basics-of-Brainfuck-and-Pseudocode" class="headerlink" title="Learn the basics of Brainfuck and Pseudocode."></a>Learn the basics of Brainfuck and Pseudocode.</h1><h2 id="What-is-Pseudocode"><a href="#What-is-Pseudocode" class="headerlink" title="What is Pseudocode?"></a>What is Pseudocode?</h2><p>Pseudocode is an readable vocabulary used for designing programs. It assists designers and developers both understand the design requirements of a program such as what the program should do and how the program will achieve what it needs to do. It is important to remember that Pseudocode is not a real programming language, but I tend to imagine it as a simplified programming language (one reason I like programming languages such as Cobol and Ruby is because they resemble Pseudocode).</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Brainfuck"><a href="#What-is-Brainfuck" class="headerlink" title="What is Brainfuck?"></a>What is Brainfuck?</h2><p>Unlike Pseudocode, Brainfuck is a real programming language. Brainfuck belongs to a categorically of programming languages referred to as esoteric-programming-languages (esolangs for short). Esolangs are real programming languages usually designed to prove a point but arent intended for industry standard use. Brainfucks design is incredibly minimlist.</p>
<h2 id="What-will-be-using-Pseudocode-for"><a href="#What-will-be-using-Pseudocode-for" class="headerlink" title="What will be using Pseudocode for?"></a>What will be using Pseudocode for?</h2><p>Brainfuck (for the most part) is not a nice programming language to write in, so to ensure we have a general idea of our program, we will use Pseudocde - which will serve as a suitable reference whilst were developing the actual program. Think of a Pseudocode as a to do list.</p>
<h2 id="What-will-be-making-using-Brianfuck"><a href="#What-will-be-making-using-Brianfuck" class="headerlink" title="What will be making using Brianfuck?"></a>What will be making using Brianfuck?</h2><p>To be honest, I cant really do much in Brainfuck, so we will be keeping things super simple and simply outputting (displaying) a line (or so) of text. This text can be your name, country just make sure it isnt too long - about less than 15 characters will be fine.</p>
<h2 id="Why-is-Pseudocode-important"><a href="#Why-is-Pseudocode-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Pseudocode important?"></a>Why is Pseudocode important?</h2><p>While it is unlikely that we will forget the end-goal of this program, for larger programs, it can be difficult (sometimes even tedious) to remember every step to our program, so we use Pseudocode to ensure we know the general outline of our program, then we can pick the language were going to develop it with and get on with other important tasks.</p>
<h2 id="The-basics-of-Brainfuck"><a href="#The-basics-of-Brainfuck" class="headerlink" title="The basics of Brainfuck"></a>The basics of Brainfuck</h2><p>Brainfuck has only 8 commands, Most tasks are generally accomplished using a while loop. It is represented by an array (a row) of cells, and has a pointer - which we will use to point to a cell of our choosing.</p>
<h2 id="Brainfuck-commands"><a href="#Brainfuck-commands" class="headerlink" title="Brainfuck commands:"></a>Brainfuck commands:</h2><ul>
<li>Increment (add) cell value</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Decrement cell value<blockquote>
<p>Move pointer one cell to the right<br>&lt; Move pointer one cell to the left<br>. Output (display) cells ASCII value<br>, Wait for input<br>[ &amp; ] These are used to signify loops, for the [ unless the current cells value is 0 it enters a loop, for the ] if the cells value is 0, it exits the loop and goes to the next instruction (assuming there is one), however, if the cells value is not 0, it will move backwards and go to the preceding instruction</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Brainfuck (depending on the version) will not read any commands other than the 8 which I have listed, this means that plain text can be written in your program, but to make things more readable we are going to use a # symbol to distinguish between our codes commands from a comment. Comments are simply just notes in the programmer for the developer.<br>I mentioned something called ASCII, on a (common) keyboard, each key has an ID, this ID is known as its ASCII value which the computer uses to associate the key with a particular character. For example, the ASCII value of the space-bar is</p>
<h2 id="Environment-Setup"><a href="#Environment-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Environment Setup"></a>Environment Setup</h2><p>We will now setup our tools and endure we are ready to work, preparation / organisation is one of the keys to successful programming so let�s prepare. To make tasks easier we will be using two tools, a Brainfuck Visualiser - which we will use to make and test our program<br>An ASCII to Text Converter - because there�s no little reason to memorise ASCII codes this tool will give us the desired value.</p>
<p>ASCII to Text Convertor:.<a href="http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/ascii/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.unit-conversion.info/texttools/ascii/</a><br>Brainfuck Visualiser: <a href="https://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://fatiherikli.github.io/brainfuck-visualizer/</a></p>
<p>The Visualiser will come in handy for debugging (finding and removing issued) our program as it displays the behavior of our program in real-time. You�re welcome to use an ASCII table of your choice so long as you have access the desired values. And a text-editor or pen+paper may come in useful for note-taking and writing our pseudocode. A calculator may be useful too. Visit the two links I provided, I recommend having them both open in separate tabs let�s delete the default example program in the Visualiser. We will now make a short Brainfuck program to ensure everything is working. Let�s output the number zero (accomplished by multiplying 16 by 3 as this equals 48 - the ASCII value for zero).</p>
<p>Code: +++ [&gt; ++++ ++++ ++++ ++++ &lt;-] &gt;.</p>
<h2 id="The-Pseudocode-of-our-program"><a href="#The-Pseudocode-of-our-program" class="headerlink" title="The Pseudocode of our program"></a>The Pseudocode of our program</h2><p>For simplicity, I�ll be using the word programming. I�m deliberately choosing an odd numbered word to demonstrate a useful technique I use (note that you may have to alter your Pseudocode if you have chosen a smaller or larger word than mine.) .</p>
<h2 id="Pseudocode"><a href="#Pseudocode" class="headerlink" title="Pseudocode:"></a>Pseudocode:</h2><p>Move pointer one cell to the right<br>Use a loop to increment this cell to 112 (by multiplying 14 by 8)<br>Move pointer one cell to the right<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Increment this cell by 2<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Decrement this cell by 3<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Decrement this cell by 8<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Increment this cell by 11<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Decrement this cell by 12<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Decrement this cell by 4<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Increment this cell by 5<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>Decrement the value of this cell by 7<br>Output the ASCII value of this cell</p>
<h2 id="The-actual-program"><a href="#The-actual-program" class="headerlink" title="The actual program"></a>The actual program</h2><p>When I typed the word programming into the ASCII -to-Text Convertor it produced the following values 112 114 111 103 114 097 109 109 105 110 103- the ASCII value of p is 112 and so on. Type your word into the ASCII-to-Text convertor and paste the values into the Brainfuck Visualiser for ease of reference like so.</p>
<p>Code: # 112 114 111 103 114 097 109 109 105 110 103</p>
<p>Here is our Pseudocode alongside the actual code (Pseudocode lines will be comments)</p>
<h2 id="Code"><a href="#Code" class="headerlink" title="Code:"></a>Code:</h2><p>// ASCII Values: 112 114 111 103 114 097 109 109 105 110 103</p>
<p>// Move pointer one cell to the right<br>+++++ +++++ ++++ [&gt; ++++ ++++ &lt; -] # Use a loop to increment this cell to 112 (by multiplying 14 by 8)<br>// Move pointer one cell to the right<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>++ // Increment this cell by 2<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>� // Decrement this cell by 3<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>�� � // Decrement this cell by 8<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>+++++ +++++ + // Increment this cell by 11<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>�� �� �� � # Decrement this cell by 12<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>+++++ +++++ ++ # Increment this cell by 7<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>�- // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>+++++ // Output the ASCII value of this cell<br>�� � // Decrement this cell by 7<br>. // Output the ASCII value of this cell</p>
<p>Note that a common goal of using Brainfuck is to make the smallest program as possible, so here is the short version of this program. As Brainfuck doesnt care about whitespace (newlines, spaces, indentations) we can have our program all on the same line, this however is generally avoided in other programming languages for readability.</p>
<h2 id="Code-1"><a href="#Code-1" class="headerlink" title="Code:"></a>Code:</h2><p>// Program which outputs the word �programming�<br>// ASCII Values: 112 114 111 103 114 097 109 109 105 110 103</p>
<p>+++++ +++++ ++++ [&gt; ++++ ++++ &lt; -] &gt; . ++ . � . �� � .<br>+++++ +++++ + . �� �� �� � . +++++ +++++ ++ . . �- .<br>+++++ . �� � .</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Congratulations, you have made a program in Brainfuck which outputs a string (a piece of text), yes you couldve done this without Pseudocode, but then you would be risking disastrous consequences such as forgetting the goal of your program, the next step you were to take and the general flow of your program - thanks to Pseudocode we can avoid these catastrophes, we can also adapt our Pseudocode and can use it for designing (and developing) programs of all sizes.</p>

<p>In this post I’ll be telling you about my (work) experience at MadeBrave - sorry for the lack of spoiler alerts. And be aware that some of the information provided here may become inaccurate due to something called time.</p>
<p>MadeBrave is a creative brand agency - they help brands with marketing. I won’t go into too much detail about them but I highly recommend you check them out - especially if you’re in Scotland.</p>
<p>A programmer is the career path I’m currently pursuing. And after some research I discovered credible experience would be incredibly valuable so I began searching for local companies (local as in less than two hours from me) who would be keen to let me spend time at their company to gain knowledge and experience. I compiled a list of over forty companies which were to be targeted. I also asked a family member at Skills Development Scotland if they knew of any companies willing to give people an opportunity to gain experience - the same family member responded with something called MadeBrave. I immediately Googled them and was super intrigued. Madebrave were offering one week long work experience. Due to a lack of confidence in my abilities: I sent an email to MadeBrave which was essentially to determine if I’d actually have a clue as to what I’d be doing during my time at MadeBrave; which I was (thankfully) encouraged to apply for the work experience opportunity regardless of experience. So I prepared my Github account for inspection, typed somewhat of a cover letter and applied. A short time after the expected response date I received an email saying I had been accepted. Yes I celebrated.</p>
<p>It was eye opening as I entered their office; so clean, tidy, colourful and welcoming. There was music playing, some people working, others talking. I was greeted by a [insert any big-word compliment here] lady who introduced me to the team. Everyone was ever so polite, I perhaps wasn’t as I was too busy looking at the Macs, all the items (more items than a gift shop) and emphasised wall decorations. Not that I’m bragging for them but they have a (real) kitchen, a VR gaming station, a loveable dog, but I�m not so sure about a decent taste in music - the (hip) digital teams was acceptable. Did I mention their collection of books contain information which could earn you a pretty penny?</p>
<p>Okay so what did I actually do at MadeBrave, I spectated some SCRUM meetings, played (sucked) at a Virtual Reality game and done some socialising. I also gained a tiny bit of useful insight into marketing using social media. I had an amazing (one sided) conversation with this [insert list of uplifting compliments here] lady. It was incredibly interesting hearing about how MadeBrave get their clients.</p>
<p>Oh you meant what work did I do? Well, I typed some HTML and discovered how much I suck at CSS by producing some landing pages. Seriously, I spent four hours trying to fix the web-pages styling only for one of the web developers to realise I had errors in the syntax of my HTML. which is why I’ll be using a HTML validator from now on. I finally learned how to make responsive websites (using media queries). I learned a ton about CSS, and most excitingly I used SASS for the first time - a preprocessor which makes CSS enjoyable again.</p>
<p>If I haven’t made it obvious by now, MadeBrave rocks, and is amazing - especially the (human and nonhuman) lifeforms The two web developers are super helpful - I was afraid to ask for help but you shouldn’t be (unless you’re stubborn like me and don’t mind making mistakes so they can be learned from). Everyone is full of knowledge - both in a variety of roles and especially in their speciality role. The environment is uplifting, unless your deadline is super near it doesn�t seem like you’re forced to do what youre supposed to e doing. I want to say the environment is fast paced but surprisingly it�s chilled (probably because of the jazz music), While I am aware both physical communication and being on your feet is generally a good thing, I partly wish they used communication software such as Slack or Discord as it can sometimes be difficult to concentrate amongst the chatter. They certainly like their chatter. They didn�t let me drive a Mustang but it is probably best that they didn’t - just as well it wasn’t a Bentley. My time there has also lead me to suspect that being around creative minds boosts creative thinking - I came up with like five possible blog post ideas amongst other ideas each day so you should definitely return to my blog, and if you do you�ll have MadeBrave to thank. I certainly have them to thank.</p>
<p>Before my week at MadeBrave I generally spent my time working on various projects which I�ll (hopefully) continue to do (whilst I hope MadeBrave offer me a chance to return). If you ever find yourself at MadeBrave: consider yourself (extremely) lucky and I’ll be surprised if you don�t enjoy it because I loved it - a week wasn’t long enough. Thankyou MadeBrave.</p>
