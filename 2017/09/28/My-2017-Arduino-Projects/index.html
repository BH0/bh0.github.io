    <h3 id="Arduino-September-Blog-Post"><a href="#Arduino-September-Blog-Post" class="headerlink" title="Arduino September Blog Post"></a>Arduino September Blog Post</h3><p>I�ve always been into electrical devices and slightly aspire to develop my own robotic application, so I was motivated to learn some electrical circuitry. Around the time of November 2016, I considered getting either the Arduino or Raspberry Pi. I decided to get the Arduino and got it during December. I continued doing some research into the device as well as general electronics. Then from January until July I vowed to make at least one electronic circuit along with its custom program (sketch) per month. And did some studying too. </p>
<p>I now feel fairly familiar with basic electronics and microcontroller programming. So this blog post will tell you about the projects which gave me the knowledge I have today. The reason I�m doing this is that I plan on increasing the scope of my projects but by adding complexity I�ll be requiring more time but I may not be able to develop as frequently as I;d like to due to other commitments. For just about every one of these projects I used: the Arduino IDE, Fritzing, and a text-editor / word processor. </p>
<p>The code and possibly a Frizzing diagram of the circuit for these projects is viewable via Github. </p>
<h3 id="January-ICanSingARainbow"><a href="#January-ICanSingARainbow" class="headerlink" title="January - ICanSingARainbow"></a>January - ICanSingARainbow</h3><p>Components: Breadboard, RGB Led, Wires<br>Description:Essentially my earliest Arduino project, all it was was an RGB LED which displayed each colour of the rainbow.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="February-MorseCode"><a href="#February-MorseCode" class="headerlink" title="February - MorseCode"></a>February - MorseCode</h3><p>A circuit and sketch which went through the alphabet in Morse code and outputted it via two LEDs.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="March-RockPaperScizzors-Simulation"><a href="#March-RockPaperScizzors-Simulation" class="headerlink" title="March -  RockPaperScizzors Simulation"></a>March -  RockPaperScizzors Simulation</h3><p>The scope of this project was way too big for the free time that I had, however it allowed me to simulate the result I wanted to achieve without running into too much hassle. I also enjoyed brainstorming the project�s user experience and interface design. At a later date I hope to return to this project and complete it.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="April-ToneTest"><a href="#April-ToneTest" class="headerlink" title="April - ToneTest"></a>April - ToneTest</h3><p>This was just to experiment with what can be done with a Piezo buzzer. I remember making an interesting �revving� sound.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="May-AlternatingLEDs"><a href="#May-AlternatingLEDs" class="headerlink" title="May - AlternatingLEDs"></a>May - AlternatingLEDs</h3><p>I originally planned to work with a DC or Servo motor and while I wrote the code for one of these motors, realised I didn�t have time to complete the circuit so I instead made a quick sketch and circuit which helped me revise some skills I had previously learnt by making two LEDs light up at different times.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="June-Piezo-Buzzer-Sketch"><a href="#June-Piezo-Buzzer-Sketch" class="headerlink" title="June - Piezo Buzzer Sketch"></a>June - Piezo Buzzer Sketch</h3><p>A circuit which I am very proud of, I made it play a small version of �Twinkle Twinkle� and also composed some tunes/melodies of my own - exercising my high school music theory knowledge. The project also gave me an opportunity to produce my own libraries (using header files).<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
<h3 id="July-Temp-Sensor-RGB-LED"><a href="#July-Temp-Sensor-RGB-LED" class="headerlink" title="July - Temp Sensor RGB LED"></a>July - Temp Sensor RGB LED</h3><p>Just a quick project to based on a combination of my early projects, instead of going through the hassle of building this circuit, I instead decided to test the sketch�s code and circuit using Circuits.io / Electronics Lab (Autodesk) - a web-based application which allows you to make and simulate circuits virtually. The LED is supposed to display a warm colour (red, orange etcetera) depending on the warmth Of The temperature sensor, or a cold colour (blue) if it is cold.<br>Code: <em>to be added</em> </p>
