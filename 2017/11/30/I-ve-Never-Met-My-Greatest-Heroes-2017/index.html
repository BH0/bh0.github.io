    <h1 id="I�ve-Never-Met-My-Greatest-Heroes-2017"><a href="#I�ve-Never-Met-My-Greatest-Heroes-2017" class="headerlink" title="I�ve Never Met My Greatest Heroes - 2017"></a>I�ve Never Met My Greatest Heroes - 2017</h1><p>While learning to program, there have been a ton of people who have helped me make it through �hard times�, and make decisions I might not have made well on my own. But I�ve never met these people - four years of learning to program and not once have I met them. </p>
<a id="more"></a> 
<p>Me not having met these altruists is a lie; I have met them, just not in person - so this blog post is just to say that when learning to program, you may feel alone and isolated, but you�re not. </p>
<p>There are thousands of people who are either going through what you�re going through - or have survived it, and even better: these people actually want to make things better for you (the reason/s why is a different blog post). </p>
<p>So, where are these people - simple: in the digital realm. </p>
<p>There are tons of digital communities (some which have in-person events too) dedicated to making the journey of a programmer easier. So don�t be afraid to visit them and ask a question every now and then (I perhaps ask too frequently at some points). </p>
<p>Some of the places I recommend at this moment are listed in this post but you�re welcome to visit wherever you please and form your own opinion. Digital communities: �Codebar.io�. Discord Servers (Reactiflux, Traversymedia, Game Dev League, Developers, Electronic Projects). Obviously there are many more and this is a thank-you to each of those helpful communities - and not that I support favoritism but a special thanks to those individuals who have had a major positive impact on my adventure . </p>
<p>One thing I will say though is: try and have netiquette, try not to waste anyones time, and don�t take the help for granted - at least take twenty or so minutes to solve your own problem first because reaching out for help. </p>
