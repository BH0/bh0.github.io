    <p>You may think its weird, but i talk to myself (more than you would think). And i encourage you to do the same. </p>
<p>I will be noting some of the reasons i talk to myself. Much of this is personal opinion. </p>
<p>Its healthy to express:<br>Humans are social animals We are wired to want to share things with others [depending on what such things are], its therapeutic for me to share my thoughts and experiences. I usually can’t concentrate if I have too many things bottled up inside nagging at me. </p>
<p>It helps me communicate - and understand, thus teach myself:<br>Its much easier to understand something if you know the reasoning process which is used. So, often times [when no one is around] i talk as if I am explaining something to someone, and even mimic a conversation by asking myself potentiel questions. Not to mention talking something i have read out loud reinforces my ability to mention it as their are two sources of input for the information [audio - ears, visual - eyes{ </p>
<p>Its also possible that no one reads my blog posts but i still continue as i believe it is helping me fill gaps in my knowledge as well as improving my communication ability. And allowing others to see my “work” means they can offer feedback which I can use for improvement. </p>
<p>This blog post was just a quick blog post to accomplish two things: I felt the need to produce + publicise something, and to inform you that you shouldn’t be afraid to do something that helps you because of what other people think - within reason of course. </p>
