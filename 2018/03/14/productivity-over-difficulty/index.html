 This blog post will hopefully offer why I favor Javascript as my language of choice despite others holding a different opinion. 
<!-- more --> 
I am going through a hopefully life-changing (for the better) time right now, and it has made me wonder the question of: "why does difficulty matter", in particular I have wondered if Javascript is not taken seriously as it was originally perceived as a "toy" language for one place only: the browser. 

Many languages have (and still do) competed with Javascript, yet it remains among the top (if not, thee top) most popular programming language. 

Now, this post isn't to convince you to use Javascript (though you should try it), its to voice my [professional] opinion that productivity should trump [thoughtless] complexity. 

Some context: I've been attempting to get myself into a HND in software development, I've looked at the course material and the language of choice is Java - typical. But essentially every project in the course can be done using Javascript, The course teaches object oriented programs, and I've shown them projects I made using object oriented techniques - so why, [does it feel like] when I've been able to demonstrate  that I know object oriented programming with Javascript, they're trying to discredit it. 

And, it is here that we see the abusing of buzzwords with a lack of understanding. Javascript, is perceived as easier than Java by these course designers using (perhaps relying on) out-of-date information. .[don't worry I know the course isn't just about the programming language]. 

But, why is Java so popular too? Simple, asides from cross platform support (which Javascript now has thanks to various projects like Node), and sharing similar features; Java is more popular as it enforces a strict set of rules, the idea is that Java behaves how a programmer who enjoys adhering to these rules expects it to - meaning that it forces people to adhere to these pre-determined rules, meaning less people do what they shouldn't do and so less work has to be returned to because of a novice developer being let loose in a vital codebase. 

Long story short, Javascript was originally a forgiving language that instead of drilling a bunch of do's and don'ts into you, is able to just let you do stuff and make interesting happen. But in my opinion, I take my hat of to fellow Javascript developers who are able to resist the temptation of eating from the cookie jar, as they often benefit from being able to spot when Javascript will [or has] lead them down a deadly trap disguised as a chocolate house. 

And for those of us who aren't so good at following rules; there are counter measures available such as linters, Typscript, strict mode. 

So, to conclude; Javascript - is good for getting something up and running with less hassle, Java - is good for making sure something can't be easily broken meaning less time is wasted of fixing such broken/flawed things. 

Conclusion: the language chosen should be chosen based on productivity, not the difficulty. If you're more productive with a language than another - use the language you're more productive with in the long run.
