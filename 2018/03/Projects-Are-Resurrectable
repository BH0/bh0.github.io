# Projects-Are-Resurrectable 
Projects [side projects, free-time projects etcetera] are a great way to further improve yourself. Developers tend to have at least one hobbyist (self-initiated) project under their belt. Whether it is a bunch of little projects, one big one or whatever.

I personally love (though sometimes dislike) projects. In fact, I have essentially replaced video-games with projects. But, there's one big problem with projects; finishing them. 

I often don't bother starting a project unless I'm convinced I can finish it - or at least get to a certain extent regarding it. So, as it happens; I have a ton of projects I want to do but haven't started yet. But  I hope this will soon change (though I'm bad at following my own advice). 

Why do I hope this will end (and suspect it will)? Because dead projects are not bad (okay maybe it a little since employer's want finishers). Why are dead projects not bad? Simple: they're not dead, just in a coma. 

The bottom line of this blog post is that you can always resurrect a project when you feel its appropriate to do so. And postpone a project whenever need be (assuming you don't have an ultimate deadline). 

If you want to work on a project, work on it. Don't be afraid of never finishing, don't be afraid of it not becoming what you expected. And often, most of the time: the journey is better than the destination.
